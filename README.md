# UrduBasic-JsCompiler
This is a transpiler for the UrduBasic programming. It transpiles UrduBasic to JavaScript.

# Compiling a file
You can compile a file by saying `shell.py inputfilename.uBasic outputname.js` in your terminal.

# Running the compiled file
The compiled file can be seprated from the compiler and be ran virtually anywhere but only when it's in the same folder as the included `values.js` file. You must also have the module `prompt-sync` installed in order to run this.
